My friend asked me to make him a poster for his comedy show on photoshop. There were several sizes, each in their own photoshop file. My friend would ask me to update the date / time, so that he could re-use the poster for another week.

I did some research online and found that there is such a thing as photoshop scripting. Three hours of research later, and I came up with this. At its heart, the script is: "give me the layer names, and the content you want in that layers - and i'll make those changes, and export as png".

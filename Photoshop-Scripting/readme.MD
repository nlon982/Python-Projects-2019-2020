My friend asked me to make him a poster for his comedy show on photoshop. There were several sizes, each in their own photoshop file. My friend would then frequently ask me to update the date / time. I knew that if I could make a tool that automated this, it would save me a lot of time.

I did some research online and found that there is such a thing as photoshop scripting. Three hours of research later, and I came up with the .py file above. At its heart, the script is: "give me the layer names, and the content you want in that layers - and i'll make those changes, and export as png". Additionally, I got it to do this for each photoshop file in the directory of the .py file.

Near the end of Compsci101, a friend messaged me about how he had made the transition from Blender to Houdini (these are 3d animation softwares). He had hundreds of materials that he used to use in Blender which he would have to manually set up in Houdini - thankfully Houdini allows you to set up nodes via Python (and they have great documentation). Houdini is a node based program, so setting up these materials would involve e.g. creating a node called "Rock Material" and then creating nodes within that node for all the different maps. The logic to do all this could be explained, and hence coded.

'v1', as i've called it here, is a version which does the job. A month after creating this, my friend asked for an addition to this code: this called 'v2' here.

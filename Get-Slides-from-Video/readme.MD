I am taking this course which provides 3rd party lecture videos (found on Youtube). Something that would improve my life is if I could have access to these slides to take notes on. So I set out to make a tool that, when given a video (which goes through a powerpoint), gives you all the slides.

I have the script go through every x amount of frames (obviously the bigger x is, the longer it takes), and compares the current frame to the next frame; if the slides are different enough, it saves that frame. With slides which have transitions (i.e. the content comes in incrementally), you'd get all of the different versions of every single slide. So I ran a second pass to go through those slides, and just take the final version of every slide - that is, logically, the slide where there is a massive difference between the current frame in the next frame.

The above logic is crass (I don't think the second pass is necessary - that could be done in the first pass), but this is something I put together as quick as possible.

So the final outcome is: you run this Python file in a folder and it takes every '.mp4' item, and obtains the slides from them - and saves them out (and additionally puts them in a pdf for convenience). I have attached an example 'ch2 1 polynomial interpolation Van der Monde matrix Wen Shen.mp4' and the corresponding folder with the slides and pdf that gets outputted after running this script.

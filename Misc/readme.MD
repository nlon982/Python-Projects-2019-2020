Miscellaneous stuff

Speech Recognition test: this was a 'couple hours' project. 
- I thought it'd be nice to have the transcripts of some videos. This would have been really easy: Google has a free tool (which you can access in Python) which you give it audio, and it returns back its best attempt at the transcript -- however, the free version will only convert small chunks of audio at a time, meaning I had to whip up something that split the audio file in to smaller chunks.

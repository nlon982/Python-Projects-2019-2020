In the summer holidays while I was working at the Auckland Council, a friend messaged me asking me about the following. He had made hundreds of 3D renders for a client, showing off their product. He was wondering if some application could be made where the user could navigate through his renders. 

I did some research and found that Python has 2-3 good mainstream GUI libraries; PyQt and Kivy. I chose to go with Kivy because I found the documentation was much better. The problem I later had with Kivy is that it didn't have that native look and feel (things like sub-pixel rendering on text is crucial, I found) e.g. it was a tremendous amount of work to have it looking like a Windows application. 

Funnily enough I went on to take a course called Compsci230 where what I had learnt about application building for this project was replicated, and extended (UML modelling, and design patterns were introduced in this course too). As to say, if I could do this project again, I would use Java - as per taught in Comp230.

I enjoyed the design process (I have attached some of this design work in the 'Design' folder), and thinking what about what classes I should have - and how the code could be structured. I enjoyed printing out the code after a crass attempt had been made, and thinking of ways to make it more elegant (this is something I have done for all my long term projcts). 

My friend ended up not needing this project any more, but I enjoyed the design process nonetheless.

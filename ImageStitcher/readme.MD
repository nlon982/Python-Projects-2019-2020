I took a course called Phil105G. The course had the resources all spread across Canvas - a week's content (called a Module) was on 15 different web pages (and there was 12 weeks of content). I wanted this content offline, and I wanted this content all in one place.

> I made a Python script that went page by page, through the content, and would save as screenshot of the entire page. I did this via clicking on a chrome extension which takes these photos, and then getting it to find and click the 'next' button at the bottom of the page. <I have been unable to find this>

> I made another Python script which then stitched together these images. I found OneNote's image compression meant I couldn't stitch together all of these images (because that'd make a massive image), so I stitched together rows of 5. This is called 'image stitcher.py'

This actually turned out to be a project that saved me a lot of time; having the content on OneNote was so helpful. I got it down to being able to learn the content for the week in 3 hours or so (and I pride this on being able to easy navigate through the content thanks to my tool).

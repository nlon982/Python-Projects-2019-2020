Sudoku Project Mid 2019:
At the start of 2019 I was enrolled in a course Compsci101. Half way through as a bit hobby, I decided to embark on making a Python program that could solve a sudoku. I wanted to do this completely from scratch from what I had learnt in Compsci101. I enjoyed sitting on the bus home from uni with a clipboard and a piece of paper, thinking of the logic of solving a sudoku - and writing pieces of code that would accomplish this. Lo' and behold, I made something that worked. 

Sudoku Project Late 2019:
I thought I was a Python programming god from Compsci101, THEN I took Compsci130. I was able to look back at all the projects I did without this knowledge, and I could see this as archaic - this was a proud moment. The main take away in this course was that we learnt about creating our own classes, so this attempt follows from the efficiencies and clarity of using classes. I came up with the structure of this program like any good project: brainstorming on paper, and landed on the design that you see here. 

Overall:
I liked doing this project as it pushed my imagination in reading and writing Python code, using the extent of my knowledge at the time.

What logic do the programs use to solve the sudoku? 
The both use the same logic, explained as follows. Have you ever not been able to find where something should go in a sudoku? Something I have always falled back on as a last resort is to go column by column, row by row, box by box, trying to find a cell with only one missing number. This is a laborious, mechanical technique. This is what this program does, it does that over and over again until it can't find a cell with only one missing number. At the time, I intended to adding in more-techniques but never got around to it. An interesting question that can be answered by making a program which only uses this technique is: can a sudoku be solved this way? The answer is that most easy Sudoku's can be solved this way, harder ones can't.

My friend came to me with the problem that the 3D assets he downloaded from the internet couldn't easily be imported in to Houdini (more specifically Redshift: the render engine he uses). The 3D assets would come with a 'mtl' file which contained all of the information needed to import the file.

We found some code online that did this task ('mtl_to_redshift_061618_og') - I felt this code was a bit archaic not a nice abstraction to extend. I spent some time re-writing this from scratch into something I found presentable ('MTL to Redshift Importer 08-01-2020'),

My friend ended up not needing this tool after I had done the above, so we left it here.
